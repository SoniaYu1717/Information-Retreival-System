# Information-Retreival-System
This a series of four software projects in which open-source tools are used to construct a “search engine” on a reasonably large text dataset. 

In **Project 1**, we use Elasticsearch, a popular open-source text search engine, to index a Wikipedia dataset to enable keyword search on the dataset. We  also apply various text transformations to the dataset during indexing and observe the effect of the transformations in search results.

In **Project 2**, we utilize ranking functions (also called Similarity Functions) to sort documents that match a certain query according to their relevance. We also work on improving the relevance of query results for our data set.

In **Project 3**, we explore different ways of implementing a basic spell checker. With the help of a spell checker, the search engine tries to guess the user's intention and recommends what is likely to be the correct spelling of whatever the user typed. 

In **Project 4**, we leverage common software tools to run two important theoretical methods: (1) Perform a rank-k approximation of a matrix using Python and (2) Perform LDA using MALLET.
